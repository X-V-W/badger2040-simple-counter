# badger 2040 simple counter

I added a simple counter program to the examples library of the Pimoroni [Badger 2040](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/badger-2040?variant=39752959852627). 
Since im not a programmer please correct me on my mistakes. 

In order to run the program you need to copy the counter.json file to the /state directory and the files counter.py and icon-coounter.jpg to the /examples directory of the [badger OS](https://github.com/pimoroni/badger2040?tab=readme-ov-file#badger-2040) via [Thonny](https://thonny.org).

b + Up or Down: count up or down by 100

c + Up or Down: count up or down by 10
